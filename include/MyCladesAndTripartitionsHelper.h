that are involved in the computation necessary to draw trees according to a flat CCP distribution (ie. a CCP distribution that would have been built from the set of all topologies with a fixed number of leaves) or a constrained CCP distribution (same as a flat CCP distribution, but where two given set of leaves must be separated by at least a branch)
